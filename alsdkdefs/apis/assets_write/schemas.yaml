# Request Params
ConditionsParam:
  type: array
  items:
    type: object
    properties:
      property:
        type: string
      type:
        type: string
      value:
        type: string
  description: |-
    A list of conditions evaluated against the asset being modified. Scope is applied to
    property names used in conditions same way as described above, e.g. if scope is `"aws"`
    and the name of the property used in a condition (value of the `"property"` field) is
    `"foo"`, then condition will be evaluated against `"scope_aws_foo"` property of the asset
    being modified.
EnvironmentIdParam:
  type: string
  description: |-
    The ID of the environment source as represented in the sources service (uppercase UUID string).
    Should be the same as the `deployment_id` in the URL.
ExclusiveParam:
  type: string
  description: |-
    This parameter can be used when the `"relationships"` parameter is used. When this
    parameter is set to `"scope"`, it will replace all relationships of the specified scope
    with those provided. When it's set to `"type"`, it will replace all relationships of the
    specified type(s) and scope with those provided. When it's set to `"complete"`, it will
    replace all relationships with those provided. If the exclusive parameter is omitted,
    all relationships provided will be added to the asset.
  enum:
    - scope
    - type
    - complete
ExclusiveTypesParam:
  type: array
  description: |-
    An array of asset types. This parameter can be used with the `exclusive=type` parameter.
    When using `exclusive=type`, these asset types will be considered for exclusion within
    the given `"scope"` in addition to the asset types of the `"relationships"` in the
    request. This allows clients to effectively declare **empty** relationships for
    specific asset type(s).
GroupNameParam:
  type: string
  description: |-
    The unique name for the `asset-group` asset, such as `my-group`. This will be the same
    as the asset `key`.
GroupPropertiesParam:
  type: object
  description: |-
    An object of properties pertaining to the asset being created. Note that an asset group
    can contain a `scopes` property, or `groups` and `groups_match` properties, but not
    both.
  properties:
    groups:
      description: |-
        An array of asset group names that define the asset groups linked to this asset group.
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
        description: An asset-group name
    groups_match:
      description: |-
        Controls the aggregation logic for the groups in the `groups` property.
        * `all` - Include any asset that is present in all of the groups in `groups`.
        * `any` - Include any asset that is present in any of the groups in `groups`.
      enum:
        - all
        - any
      type: string
    scopes:
      description: |-
        An array of scope objects that define the asset membership in the group. Each `scope`
        object represents distinct, independent criteria for group inclusion. If an asset meets
        the criteria defined in **any** scope, it will be included in the group.
      type: array
      items:
        type: object
        properties:
          include:
            description: |-
              An array of topological constraints on assets that define the asset membership in the
              group. Examples: `deployment:any`, `tag:/tag/name/environment/value/production`,
              `host:!/aws/us-east-1/i-1234`. Any groupable asset that meets the constraints on it
              (and whose topological ancestor assets meet the constraints on them) will be included
            type: array
            items:
              type: string
          exclude:
            description: |-
              An array of topological constraints on assets that define the asset membership in the
              group. Examples: `deployment:any`, `tag:/tag/name/environment/value/production`,
              `host:!/aws/us-east-1/i-1234`. Any groupable asset that meets the constraints on it
              (and whose topological ancestor assets meet the constraints on them) will be
              **excluded** from the group, even if they meet the `includes` criteria.
            type: array
            items:
              type: string
          asset_types:
            description: |-
              An array of asset types strings that define what type(s) of assets can be in the group.
              If set, only assets of the given type(s) will be included in the group. If not, all
              groupable asset types are eligible to be included in the group.
            type: array
            items:
              type: string
KeyParam:
  type: string
  description: |-
    The opaque, unique key for this asset, such as `"/aws/us-east-1/host/i-1234567"`. The
    key and type parameters form a unique identifier for any asset.
PropertiesParam:
  type: string
  description: |-
    An object whose properties pertain to the asset being created or modified. This may
    be omitted if no properties are needed. Scope is applied to properties in the following
    way: if scope is `"aws"` and the property is `"foo": "bar"`, it becomes
    `"scope_aws_foo": "bar"`. When subsequently querying the asset, some properties are
    promoted depending on the asset type. These properties are
    [merged](#api-_-merge-properties) onto an existing asset's properties, if present.
RelationshipsParam:
  type: array
  items:
    type: object
    properties:
      key:
        $ref: '#/KeyParam'
      type:
        $ref: '#/TypeParam'
  description: |-
    A list of objects describing relationships to other assets. Each object in this list
    must have a `"type"` field and a `"key"` describing the type and key of asset the new
    or updated asset will have a relationship to. The object may also have a
    `"relationship_type"` field indicating the type of relationship to declare. Note that
    relationships to and from type `"tag"` have [special constraints](#api-_-tag-rel-constraints)
    that clients should be aware of.
ScopeParam:
  type: string
  description: |-
    The declaring software's authority or area of function. For example, the scan subsystem
    declaring vulnerabilities passes scope `"scan"`, and the UI declaring a credential for
    an asset passes scope `"config"`. `cloud_explorer`, responsible for discovering
    deployments (environments), passes `"aws"`. The scope must match the regex pattern
    `[0-9A-Za-z-]`.
StrategyParam:
  type: string
  description: |-
    This parameter is used by the accumulate operation. Based on this paramenter, the
    `"accumulate"` operation will increment the current calendar hour counter, shift hours
    when the next hour is reached, etc. Currently, only `hourly` is supported.
TypeParam:
  type: string
  description: |-
    The type of the asset being created or modified. It must be one of the
    [supported asset types](#api-_-asset-types). See also the
    [deprecated asset types](#api-_-deprecated-asset-types) for additional types that are
    supported through asset type aliasing. Together, the `"key"` and `"type"` parameters
    form a unique identifier for any asset within a deployment.
VulnerableTypeParam:
  type: string
  description: |-
    The type of the vulnerable asset being referred to. It must be one of the
    [supported vulnerable asset types](#api-_-vulnerable-asset-types). Together, the
    `"key"` and `"type"` parameters form a unique identifier for any asset within a deployment.
