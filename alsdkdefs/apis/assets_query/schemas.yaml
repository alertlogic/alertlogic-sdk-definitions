            All assets are decorated with a few additional properties:

            1. A `group_membership` property that must be consulted to determine membership in the group. Possible values are described below:

            `IN` - The asset is included in the group by scope definition.

            `CONTAINS` - The asset does not meet the full criteria for inclusion in the group, but contains at least one successor asset in the group.

            `CAN_CONTAIN` - The asset does not meet the full criteria for inclusion in the group. The scope definition does allow this asset to
            potentially include future successors in the group.

            `EXCLUDED` - The asset is excluded from the group by scope definition.

            `NOT_IN` - The asset does not meet all criteria for inclusion in the group by scope definition, but is not explicitly excluded.

            2. A `membership_counts` object containing keys of asset types and an object value of `in` and `not_in` counts for topological child types.
            If an asset has no topological children but is of a type that could have topological children (e.g. a region that
            currently does not have any declared vpcs yet), the membership_counts object may be an empty object `{}`.
