    If a `filters set` is provided, one `remediation-item` per unique `filters` in the `filters set` will be

    `deployment_id`) and `remediation_ids`/`vulnerability_ids` as well.

    to propagate the change to the asset model for an account under high load, but this endpoint will
    still return the result of the database update after a finite time to prevent deadlock, regardless of
    whether the change has propagated to the asset model.

            references (that can be resolved by looking up the reference in the `topology.data`
            object) that describe topological relationship sequences. Note that all groupable assets
            are returned in the rows, but the `topology.data` object must be consulted for each asset to determine
            its inclusion or exclusion from the group. Intermediate topology assets do not have their own row in
            the result (a VPC with subnets would not have an entry, but a VPC without subnets would have an entry).
        data:
          type: object
          description: |-
            An object containing all of the asset details for asset references in the
            `topology.assets`. The object keys are asset
            references produced by colon-joining deployment ID, asset type and asset key, e.g.,
            `814C2911-09BB-1005-9916-7831C1BAC182:region:/aws/us-east-1`.

            All assets are decorated with a few additional properties:

            1. A `group_membership` property that must be consulted to determine membership in the group. Possible values are described below:

            `EXPLICIT_IN` - The asset is included in the group by scope definition. This status is returned for the first assets
            in the asset topology that match all of the inclusion filters for scope in scoped groups, and the only `IN` membership type for
            groups with nested groups.

            `INHERIT_IN` - The asset is included in the group by scope definition. This status is returned for any topological successor
            asset of an asset with the `EXPLICIT_IN` group membership that meets the exclusion criteria. This membership type is not
            returned for assets in a group with nested groups.

            `CONTAINS` - The asset does not meet the full criteria for inclusion in the group, but contains at least one successor asset in the group.

            `CAN_CONTAIN` - The asset does not meet the full criteria for inclusion in the group. The scope definition does allow this asset to
            potentially include future successors in the group.

            `EXPLICIT_EXCLUDED` - The asset is excluded from the group by scope definition. This status is returned for the first assets in
            the asset topology that match any exclusion filters for scope in scoped groups.

            `INHERIT_EXCLUDED` - The asset is excluded from the group by scope definition. This status is returned for any topological successor
            asset of an asset with the `EXPLICIT_EXCLUDED` group membership. This membership type is not returned for assets in a group with nested
            groups.

            `NOT_IN` - The asset does not meet all criteria for inclusion in the group by scope definition, but is not explicitly excluded.

            2. A `membership_counts` object containing keys of asset types and an object value of `in` and `not_in` counts for topological child types.
            If an asset has no topological children but is of a type that could have topological children (e.g. a region that
            currently does not have any declared vpcs yet), the membership_counts object may be an empty object `{}`.
