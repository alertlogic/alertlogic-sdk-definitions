      **Note:** The previous v2 API of this service has been deprecated.

      The **Otis** service manages tuning options specified by a customer. The defined
      options are consumed by various services to operate in accordance with the
      customer's preferences.

        * [Option Representation](#option-representation)
        * [Scope Resolving Algorithm](#scope-resolving-algorithm)
        * [Supported Options](#supported-options)

      <a name="option-representation"/>

      ## Option Representation

      An option is a container for the following properties:

      * **id** - a unique value (UUID) calculated as hash from name + scope
      * **name** - a name from the list of supported options
      * **scope** - some optional scope the option is applied for
      * **value** - arbitrary JSON data

      The option ID is a hash calculated by the service based on the option name and
      scope combination. It is possible to define only one value for one unique scope.

      A client can provide multiple option values with different scope. Consumers can
      use the resolve endpoint to find the most suitable option value for a target
      scope. If scope is missing then an option is applied on the account level.

      Values can be provided on the deployment level and override the account level
      values, for example:

      ```
      "scope": {
          "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
      }
      ```

      The region level values have higher priority, for example:

      ```
      "scope": {
          "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
          "region_key": "/aws/us-east-1"
      }
      ```

      The VPC level values have the highest priority, for example:

      ```
      "scope": {
          "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
          "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
      }
      ```

      A value depends on the option name and can contain arbitrary JSON data. Please
      see the section [Supported Option](#supported-options) for information about
      valid option values.

      <a name="scope-resolving-algorithm"/>

      ## Scope Resolving Algorithm

      The service provides the [resolve](#api-Resolve-ResolveOptions) endpoint that
      helps to find the most specific option value for the target scope in case of
      multiple values specified in different scope.

      The algorithm consists of two parts:

      1. exclude all values defined for more narrow scope than the target one
      2. select the best value having maximum number of matching scope properties

      For example, there are 3 values for the same option defined in the different scope:
      <table style="text-align:center">
        <tr style="background-color:#f5f5f5">
          <td>scope/value</th>
          <td>1</th>
          <td>2</th>
          <td>3</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#f5f5f5">account_id</td>
          <td>12345678</td>
          <td>12345678</td>
          <td>12345678</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#f5f5f5">deployment_id</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA</td>
          <td>AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#f5f5f5">region_key</td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
          <td>/aws/us-east-1</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      If the target scope is: `{"deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"}`
      then the value `2` wins because the value `3` is defined for the more narrow
      scope and the value `1` has fewer matching scope properties.

      <a name="supported-options"/>

      <a name="cross_network_protection"/>

      ### cross_network_protection

      This option declares that a given scope is protected by remote IDS appliances
      from security infrastructure deployed inside another network. All agents running
      inside the protected scope connect to IDS appliances running in the protecting
      network.

      A value is an object containing a deployment ID and and asset key of the
      assigned protecting network, for example, a protected network can be declared
      like this:
      ```
      {
          "name": "cross_network_protection",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
              "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
          },
          "value": {
              "deployment_id": "BBBBBBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBBBBBBBBBB"
              "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000002"
          }
      }
      ```

      or some protected region can be declared as below:

      ```
      {
          "name": "cross_network_protection",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
              "region_key": "/aws/us-east-1"
          },
          "value": {
              "deployment_id": "BBBBBBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBBBBBBBBBB"
              "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000002"
          }
      }
      ```

      <a name="discovery_scan_frequency"/>

      ### discovery_scan_frequency

      This option specifies the number of discovery scans to be performed during a day.

      The value can be either the string `"automatic"` or an integer from [`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`],

      for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "discovery_scan_frequency",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
          },
          "value": 1
      }
      ```

      <a name="external_scan_frequency"/>

      ### external_scan_frequency

      This option specifies the external scan frequency.

      The value can be one of the strings [`"automatic"`, `"daily"`, `"weekly"`, `"monthly"`],
      for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "external_scan_frequency",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
          },
          "value": "daily"
      }
      ```

      <a name="ids_appliance_instance_type"/>

      ### ids_appliance_instance_type

      This option specifies an instance type that the installation services shall use
      to launch IDS appliances inside the defined scope. The option affects deployments
      in **automatic** mode only.

      The value is a string containing a value from the following supported range:

      <table style="text-align:center">
        <tr style="background-color:#f5f5f5">
          <td>type</th>
          <td>size</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#f5f5f5">t3</td>
          <td style="font-style:italic">t3.medium, t3.large, t3.xlarge, t3.2xlarge</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#f5f5f5">m4</td>
          <td style="font-style:italic">m4.large, m4.xlarge, m4.2xlarge, m4.4xlarge, m4.10xlarge, m4.16xlarge</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#f5f5f5">m5</td>
          <td style="font-style:italic">m5.large, m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge, m5.4xlarge, m5.12xlarge, m5.24xlarge</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td style="font-style:italic">c4.large, c4.xlarge, c4.2xlarge, c4.4xlarge, c4.8xlarge</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#f5f5f5">c5</td>
          <td style="font-style:italic">c5.large, c5.xlarge, c5.2xlarge, c5.4xlarge, c5.9xlarge, c5.18xlarge</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "ids_appliance_instance_type",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
              "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
          },
          "value": "c5.large"
      }
      ```

      The following instance types are used as defaults: `c5.xlarge`, `m5.xlarge`, `c4.xlarge`
      depending on availability, if the option is not defined.

      <a name="ids_appliances_placement"/>

      ### ids_appliances_placement (BETA)

      Please notice, this is a **BETA** option that may be a subject for change.

      This option declares placement `policy` for a selected scope. There are two
      policies supported so far:

      1. `automatic` - placement managed by Alert Logic

          By default, we deploy one IDS appliance per every inhabited availability zone
          inside a protected VPC. Useless appliances are removed, when there are no hosts
          inside availability zones. Also, one hot appliance is never terminated in one of
          availability zones for empty VPC.

          Two flavors of automatic management supported now:

          1. Automatic with maximum number of protected zones

              A customer can protect some VPC by IDS appliances running in a limited number
              of availability zones. An optional integer property `max_zones` defines the
              maximum number of zones allowed to have appliances inside. Security
              infrastructure is removed from empty zones automatically.

              For example:
              ```
              {
                  "name": "ids_appliances_placement",
                  "scope": {
                      "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
                  },
                  "value": {
                      "policy": "automatic",
                      "max_zones": 1
                  }
              }
              ```

          2. Automatic with a list of protected zones defined explicitly

              A customer can also protect some VPC by appliances inside the specific
              availability zones only. A policy option `zone_keys` defines zones allowed
              to deploy IDS appliances. Security infrastructure is automatically removed
              from empty zones automatically.

              For example:
              ```
              {
                  "name": "ids_appliances_placement",
                  "scope": {
                      "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
                      "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
                  },
                  "value": {
                      "policy": "automatic",
                      "zone_keys": [
                          "/aws/us-east-1/zone/us-east-1a"
                      ]
                  }
              }
              ```

      2. `constant` - placement predefined by a customer

          Sometimes customers know that there are availability zones with stable
          infrastructure generating traffic, so IDS appliances should be deployed to the
          preferred zones only and never removed regardless zone population. A policy
          option `zone_keys` defines zones where IDS appliances need to be deployed. Traffic
          from the rest of availability zones will be handled by the appliances living in
          the preferred zones.

          For example:
          ```
          {
              "name": "ids_appliances_placement",
              "scope": {
                  "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
                  "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
              },
              "value": {
                  "policy": "constant",
                  "zone_keys": [
                      "/aws/us-east-1/zone/us-east-1a",
                      "/aws/us-east-1/zone/us-east-1b"
                  ]
              }
          }
          ```

      <a name="ids_appliances_scaling"/>

      ### ids_appliances_scaling (BETA)

      Please notice, this is a **BETA** option that may be a subject for change.

      The option affects **AWS** deployments in the **automatic** mode only.

      This option declares IDS appliances scaling for a selected scope. The option
      value is an object that specifies the desired policy. There are two policies
      available so far, `automatic` and `constant`.

      1. `automatic` - the number of appliances adjusted automatically

          Once it is selected, then auto-scaling groups in the protected zones will be
          automatically adjusted to the actual load (the number of agents collecting
          traffic) respecting the predefined limits.

          For example:

          ```
          {
              "name": "ids_appliances_scaling",
              "scope": {
                  "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
                  "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
              },
              "value": {
                  "policy": "automatic",
                  "max_instances": 3
              }
          }
          ```

          If it is detected that all existing appliances inside the protected zone are
          too close to overloaded state, a new IDS appliance is launched and existing
          agents are rebalanced accordingly. The number of appliances can be limited
          with extra options `min_instances` affecting the lower boundary, and
          `max_instances` (8 by default) for the upper boundary. When it is detected
          that some appliance is idle or its termination will not affect traffic
          analysis, the useless appliance is terminated to save resources.

      2. `constant` - the constant number of appliances predefined in advance

          Sometimes it is well known that there is a network with a stable load (the
          number of agents collecting traffic) inside the protected infrastructure, so
          the appropriate number of IDS appliances can be deployed to the preferred
          zones and never scaled down. A policy option `num_instances` defines the
          number of appliances to be launched by the auto-scaling group inside every
          protected zone.

          For example:
          ```
          {
             "name": "ids_appliances_scaling",
              "scope": {
                  "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
                  "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
              },
              "value": {
                  "policy": "constant",
                  "num_instances": 1
              }
          }
          ```

      <a name="ids_security_resource_tags"/>

      ### ids_security_resource_tags

      This option specifies additional tags to be associated with resources deployed
      automatically as parts of the IDS security infrastructure. The option affects
      AWS deployments in the **automatic** and **guided** mode only.

      Please see [security_resource_tags](#security_resource_tags) for details.

      <a name="max_vulnerability_scan_jobs"/>

      The value is an integer, for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "max_vulnerability_scan_jobs",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
          },
          "value": 10
      }
      ```

      <a name="max_discovery_scan_jobs"/>

      ### max_discovery_scan_jobs

      The value is an integer, for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "max_discovery_scan_jobs",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
              "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
          },
          "value": 10
      }
      ```

      <a name="predefined_security_subnet"/>

      ### predefined_security_subnet

      This option specifies what subnet shall be used as a security subnet by automatic
      installation services to deploy scan appliances. The option affects deployments
      in **guided** mode only.

      The value is a string containing a subnet asset key,
      for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "predefined_security_subnet",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
              "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
          },
          "value": "/aws/us-east-1/subnet/subnet-00000001"
      }
      ```

      <a name="scan_appliance_instance_type"/>

      ### scan_appliance_instance_type

      This option specifies an instance type that the installation services shall use
      to launch scan appliances inside the defined scope. The option affects deployments
      in **automatic** or **guided** mode only.

      The value is a string containing a value from the following supported range:

      <table style="text-align:center">
        <tr style="background-color:#f5f5f5">
          <td>type</th>

      </table>

      for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "scan_appliance_instance_type",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
              "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
          },
          "value": "c5.large"
      }
      ```

      The following instance types are used as defaults: `m3.medium`, `c5.large`, `c4.large`
      depending on availability, if the option is not defined.

      <a name="scan_appliances_scaling"/>

      ### scan_appliances_scaling

      This option specifies a scaling policy that deployment services shall follow
      launching scan appliances inside the protected scope. The option affects AWS
      deployments in **automatic**, **guided** and **manual** mode only.

      The option value is an object that specifies the desired policy. There are two
      policies available so far, `automatic` and `constant`.

      If the policy `automatic` is selected, then auto-scaling groups will be
      automatically configured to run one scan appliance while not-scanned instances
      found in the protected VPC, and scaled down to zero once all the targets are
      scanned,
      for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "scan_appliances_scaling",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
              "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
          },
          "value": {
              "policy": "automatic"
          }
      }
      ```

      If the policy `constant` is set, then auto-scaling groups will be configured to
      run the desired number of scan appliances and never scaled down, for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "scan_appliances_scaling",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
              "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
          },
          "value": {
              "policy": "constant",
              "num_instances": 1
          }
      }
      ```

      By default, our deployment service follows the policy `automatic`.

      <a name="scan_security_resource_tags"/>

      ### scan_security_resource_tags

      This option specifies additional tags to be associated with resources deployed
      automatically as parts of the Scan security infrastructure. The option affects
      AWS deployments in the **automatic** and **guided** mode only.

      Please see [security_resource_tags](#security_resource_tags) for details.

      <a name="scan_security_subnet_cidr_block"/>

      ### scan_security_subnet_cidr_block

      This option specifies a CIDR block to be assigned to a security subnet.
      A deployment service creates a security subnet in the protected VPC to deploy
      scan appliances, the created subnet is configured to use some free block of /28
      size. Once the option is defined, the created security subnet will be configured
      with the predefined CIDR block. The option affects AWS deployments in
      the **automatic** mode only.

      The value is a string specifying a CIDR block with the allowed netmask between
      `/16` and `/28`, for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "scan_security_subnet_cidr_block",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
              "vpc_key": "/aws/us-east-1/vpc/vpc-00000000000000001"
          },
          "value": "10.0.1.0/28"
      }
      ```

      <a name="security_resource_tags"/>

      ### security_resource_tags

      This option specifies additional tags to be associated with security resources
      deployed by deployment services. The option affects AWS deployments in the
       **automatic** and **guided** mode only.

      The value is an array of objects specifying desired tag keys and values,
      for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "security_resource_tags",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
          },
          "value": [
              {
                  "key": "Key",
                  "value": "Value"
              }
          ]
      }
      ```

      All the list items must be unique. The maximum number of tags allowed is 30.
      Also, the key prefix `AlertLogic` is reserved and any prefixed tags will be rejected.

      <a name="span_port_enabled"/>

      ### span_port_enabled

      This option is a hint that IDS appliances detected in VPC must be configured as
      span port connected.

      The value is boolean, for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "span_port_enabled",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA",
              "vpc_key": "/dc/network/BBBBBBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBBBBBBBBBB"
          },
          "value": true
      }
      ```

      <a name="vulnerability_scan_frequency"/>

      ### vulnerability_scan_frequency

      This option specifies the vulnerability scan frequency.

      The value can be one of the strings [`"automatic"`, `"daily"`, `"weekly"`, `"monthly"`],
      for example:

      ```
      {
          "name": "vulnerability_scan_frequency",
          "scope": {
              "deployment_id": "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
          },
          "value": "daily"
      }
      ```
