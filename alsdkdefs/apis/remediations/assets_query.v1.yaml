    ## Introduction
    The Assets service manages customer asset models. More specifically, Assets stores a customer's
    assets (hosts, subnets, vpcs, load balancers, IAM users, etc.) and the relationships between
    them. Assets provides a general query mechanism to retrieve the stored data: assets query
    service.

    All of the examples in this document use curl and jq. curl can be installed via
    [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) on Windows, or via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) or
    [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) on OS X. curl should already be installed on any Linux or
    Unix system. jq can be downloaded from
    [https://stedolan.github.io/jq/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

    ### Principles
    Assets works in objects and relationships. With a few restrictions, assets will store what you
    ask it to store. It will not modify object values or relationships unless requested. It does
    add some fields to objects and relationships.

    Properties of objects are stored as `scope_$SCOPE_$PROPERTYNAME`. If you declared property `bar`
    with scope `foo`, then the property would be named `scope_foo_bar`. Some scope and property name
    combinations are automatically "promoted" so that both `scope_foo_bar` and `bar` are declared as
    properties with the same value. Modifying one, though, will not modify the other.

    The relationships between objects have many different uses. Some relationships are topological
    and represent the relationships between regions, VPCs, subnets, hosts, etc. Some relationships
    are declarative and represent information such as the AMI a hosts was started from, or which
    Auto Scaling Groups are associated with an Elastic Load Balancer. If a relationship is declared
    to an asset that doesn't exist, this asset will not be returned by assets_query until it is
    declared.

    All URLs for the assets query service are under `/assets_query/v1/$ACCOUNT_ID`. Most are under
    `/assets_query/v1/$ACCOUNT_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID`.

    All assets read requests are in the form of `GET` requests.

    *Note*: some assets use a `threatiness` property which is an internal measurement used for
    relative comparison and is not considered useful to customers.

    ### Data Types
    Asset properties may be boolean, numeric (integer or float), string, or one dimensional arrays
    of those types.

    ## Usage
    This section contains advice and tips of how to interact with the assets query service.

    All calls to assets query service must be authenticated. Authentication is done via a token
    obtained from the AIMS service. The following will get a token and store it in `$AL_TOKEN`
    given a valid email address and password:

    ```
    export AL_TOKEN=`curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" --user "$EMAIL_ADDRESS:$PASSWORD"
    https://api.cloudinsight.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/authenticate | jq -r .authentication.token`
    ```
    *Note: you must use https://api.cloudinsight.alertlogic.co.uk if your console is at
    https://console.cloudinsight.alertlogic.co.uk.*

    This token will be passed as the value of the `x-aims-auth-token` header.

    ### Querying Assets

    #### Simple query
    The most basic request for assets is to get all assets, and this may be a lot of data.
    [Here is an example returning relatively small number of assets](#operation/query_assets). A
    realistic response would have many more assets.

    ### Deployment-specific query
    You can reduce results of your request by providing particular deployment ID as part of the
    request. [Here is an example for a deployment](#operation/query_deployment_assets).

    #### Typed queries

    If you want to get only a certain type of asset, you can limit the asset types using
    `?asset_types=region` or `?asset_types=name:region`. However, although `?asset_types=region`
    is equivalent to `?asset_types=region:region`, the latter is preferred since it allows more
    flexibility when querying relationships. An example can be found under
    [get just region assets](#operation/query_assets).

    Once you've declared an asset type in your query, you can refer to it in subsequent query
    parameters using its name: `?asset_types=r:region&r.created_on=1447260845785`.

    The `asset_types` parameter can be used to query for long chains of related assets.

    #### Filtering assets

    Assets that are requested via the `asset_types` parameter can be filtered by the URL query
    string. If `assets?asset_types=r:region,v:vpc,s:subnet` is requested, any of `r`, `v`, or `s`
    could be filtered by their property values.

    If you want to find only VPCs and subnets within the us-east-1 region, you can limit the query
    by specifying `r.name=us-east-1`:

    Like in the [VPCs and Subnets in us-east-1 General Query example](#operation/query_assets).

    Assets supports queries with filters more complex than equality. The operator (special
    character(s)) is placed immediately after the equals sign in the query string parameter.

    | Operation             | Character(s)   | Format               | Example                          |
    |-----------------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
    | Greater than          | `>`            | String or number     | `x.y=>5`, `x.y=>Gryffindor`      |
    | Less than             | `<`            | String or number     | `x.y=<5`, `x.y=<Slytherin`       |
    | Not equal             | `!`            | Scalar               | `x.name=!Draco`                  |
    | Is not                | `!!`           | Scalar               | `x.name=!!Draco`                 |
    | Is null               | `$null`        | None                 | `x.name=$null`                   |
    | Is one of             | `@` or `<<`    | Comma separated list | `x.name=@Harry,Ron,Hermione`     |
    | Is not one of         | `!@` or `!<<`  | Comma separated list | `x.name=!@Harry,Ron,Hermione`    |
    | List contains         | `>>`           | Scalar               | `x.parents=>>Lilly`              |
    | List does not contain | `!>>`          | Scalar               | `x.parents=!>>Lilly`             |
    | String contains       | `%`            | String               | `x.name=%Percival`               |
    | Regex Match           | `~`            | String               | `x.name=~neighbou?r`             |
    | CIDR IP matching      | `:cidr_match:` | String               | `x.ip=:cidr_match:192.168.0.0/16`|

    There is no way to escape these special characters.

    Using "not equal" vs. "is not": the "not equal" operator `!` will never match an asset on which
    the property being queried is not defined; the "is not" operator `!!` will always match assets
    on which the property being queried is not defined. Use "is not" to mean "anything other than,
    including null/undefined" and use "not equal" to mean "is defined but not equal to".

    The value to filter is automatically cast to boolean, integer, or string. To override the type
    cast and perform a string comparison, the filter value can be prefixed with `:$str:`, such as
    `tag.tag_value=:$str:1234`. Floats are treated as strings. Arrays are treated as strings. The
    following table describes the query string value and the value used in the query (as the
    JSON-equivalent value) (unless override is specified).

    | Query string value | Type   | JSON-equivalent value |
    |--------------------|--------|-----------------------|
    | `true`             | bool   | `true`                |
    | `false`            | bool   | `false`               |
    | `:$str:true`       | string | `"true"`              |
    | `:$str:false`      | string | `"false"`             |
    | `1234`             | int    | `1234`                |
    | `-1234`            | int    | `-1234`               |
    | `:$str:1234`       | string | `"1234"`              |
    | `1.234`            | string | `"1.234"`             |
    | `[1,2,3]`          | string | `"[1,2,3]"`           |
    | `abc`              | string | `"abc"`               |

    #### Filtering assets by relationship

    Assets that are requested via the `asset_types` parameter can be filtered by relationships to
    assets not requested by using the relationship operator, `..` to express relationship queries
    to other asset types. Look at [the General Query examples](#operation/query_assets) that find
    subnets tagged Foo, as well as without the tag Foo and without any tags.

    #### Using the `any` asset type
    There is a fake asset type called `any`. The `any` asset type can be used in the `asset_types`
    parameter to allow any type. When combined with filters, a relationship to a set of asset types
    can be matched. Check out the [General Query examples](#operation/query_assets) for a demo.

    ### Exposures and Remediations

    **Note** that `remediations/v1` endpoint documentation is located in the Remediations service documentation.

    The Assets Query service provides a set of endpoints for handling exposures in the Alert Logic product.
    A remediation is a conceptual set of work to do to fix a vulnerability. Many asset types may be
    vulnerable, such as `host`, `vpc`, `db-instance`, `user`, etc.

    When an asset is vulnerable, it has a `vulnerability` asset related to it. The vulnerability is
    related to a `remediation` asset.

    *Note*: remediations uses a `threatiness` property which is an internal measurement used for
    relative comparison and is not considered useful to customers.

    A `remediation-item` is an indication of intent to do (or not do) work for a subset of
    vulnerabilities on vulnerable assets. A `remediation-item` may have a set of filters which limit
    which vulnerable assets the `remediation-item` applies to.

    A `remediation-item` may be in one of the following states:

    ### "planned"
    This is the initial state. A user has committed to performing the work necessary to fix a
    vulnerability. The `remediation-item` has a `user_id` and `filters` fields. The `user_id` is the
    user who added the remediations to their plan. The `filters` field is a list of
    [filter](#section/Remediation-filters) strings.

    ### "disposed"
    A remediation-item may be "disposed," indicating that the vulnerabilities identified by the
    `remediation-item` are not important enough to work on. A remediation may be disposed for one
    of three different reasons: `"acceptable_risk"`, `"compensating_control"`, `"false_positive"`.
    A comment and expiration date are also required to dispose a remediation-item.

    ### "complete"
    A `remediation-item` may be moved to the `complete` state. This is used to indicate that the
    user that owns the `remediation-item` has completed the work and believes the vulnerabilities
    attached to the `remediation-item` have been resolved.

    If the vulnerable assets are scanned again and found to have the vulnerabilities, the
    `remediation-item` state will revert to `planned`.

    ### Remediation filters
    When talking about remediations and `remediation-items`, it's important to consider any filters
    that limit the scope of a set of vulnerabilities or a `remediation-item`. Remediation items also
    have a (possibly empty) list of `filters`. The filter limits the scope of the remediations
    requested (for GET requests) or limits the scope of a `remediation-item`.

    The filter is composed of two parts: the filter type and the limiting property of the filter.
    The limiting property is a field that must match vulnerable assets. E.g. the filter
    `"image:/aws/us-east-1/image/ami-12345678"` means that a `remediation-item` only applies to
    vulnerabilities declared on the image with key `"/aws/us-east-1/image/ami-12345678"`. Different
    filters use a different limiting property: most use the `key` property of an asset, but not all.

    #### Identity and relational filters
    There are a number of classes of filters. The two main classes are relational filters and
    identity filters. Relational filters yield assets (and their vulnerabilities) that have
    relationships to the filtered asset. A filter type can be both a relational filter and an
    identity filter. For example, `"sg:/aws/us-east-1/sg/sg-12345678"` will filter relationships
    on the security group with that key and assets within that security group. These classes are
    identified with `I` and `R` in the table below.

    #### Using CSVs in filters
    Some filters allow passing a comma-separated list (CSV) of limiting property values, indicating
    that only remediations/exposures that contain **at least one** of the given values will be
    returned. This is identified with `C` in the table below.

    #### Using negation in filters
    Some filters allow prefixing a value (or a comma-separated list (CSV)) with `!`, indicating
    that only remediations/exposures that **do not** meet the filter criteria will be returned. This
    is identified with `!` in the table below.

    #### The `any` limiting property value
    Some filters allow the limiting property value to be `any`, indicating that only
    remediations/exposures that apply to the specific filter type will be returned. These are part of
    the `any` class of filters. E.g. the filter `"s3-bucket:any"` yields only vulnerabilities on
    s3-buckets. This is identified with `A` in the table below.

    #### The `none` limiting property value
    Some filters allow the limiting property value to be `none`, indicating that only
    remediations/exposures that do not apply to the specific filter type will be returned. These are
    part of the `none` class of filters. E.g. the filter `"cve:none"` yields only exposures whose
    vulnerabilities `cve` field isn't set. This is identified with `N` in the table below.

    #### Allowable Filters

    The following table is a list of supported asset filters:

    | Type                | Limiting Property | Class<sup>1</sup> | Example | Notes |

    Notes:
    1. ! = negation allowed, A = `any` allowed, C = CSV allowed, I = identity, R = relational, N = `none` allowed.
    2. The region filter will also be relational in the near future.
    3. This selects only assets that have the vulnerability specified by the vulnerability key.
       This will only ever return a single remediation on a single asset.

        ### Create/Rename/Update/Delete Asset Group
        Creates, renames, updates, or deletes an `asset-group` asset. On deletion, deletes any references in linked groups.
        If a linked group has only a single reference in it, and would be emptied as a result
        it will also be deleted. On rename, linked groups (that reference the renamed group) also have their reference updated.

        Finds a list of assets quickly using known identifiers. This endpoint is limited to specific
        asset types, currently: agents, appliances, hosts and remote sources.  If the asset is
        found, the response will contain the asset details, keyed by the identifiers in the request
        parameters. If the asset is not found, the response will contain a `null` value, keyed by
        the identifiers in the request parameters.

        Collector results are keyed by the `uuid` property in the request parameters.

        When a host is found by appliance, results are keyed by the `uuid` and `ip_address` request
        parameters, separated by `,`.

        When a host is found by network, results are keyed by the `network_uuid` and `ip_address`
        request parameters, separated by `,`.

        Fetches details and elaborations about individual assets and their surroundings, such as
        complete asset details or an asset's network neighborhood or connectivity. The query string
        parameters for different details operations are grouped together:

        To get details of an asset by `type`, `key`, `deployment`, and `region`, specify the
        following query parameters:

        * `type` (must be `host`)
        * `key`
        * `deployment`
        * `region`

        To get details of an asset by `type` and `deployment`, specify the following query
        parameters:

        * `type` (must be `deployment`)
        * `deployment`

        To get details of an asset by `appliance_uuid` and `ip_address`, specify the following
        query parameters:

        * `appliance_uuid`
        * `ip_address`
        * `port` (optional, always provide if available)

        To get details of an asset by `type` and `uuid`, specify the following query parameters:

        * `type` (default: `any`)
        * `uuid`

        To get details of an asset by `deployment`, `ip addresses` and `network`, specify the following query parameters:

        * `deployment`
        * `ip_address`
        * `network`

        Note that when calling this endpoint with query options `deployment`, `network` and `ip_address` set, if a host is found,
        any subnet that the host isn't related to but it could be (the IP address matches the subnet mask) the additional unrelated
        subnet(s) will be returned under the `subnet` key in the response.

      summary: Get Asset Details
      description: |-
        Fetches details and elaborations about individual assets and their surroundings, such as
        complete asset details or an asset's network neighborhood or connectivity. The request body json
        for different details operations are grouped together:

        To get details of an asset by `type`, `key`, `deployment`, and `region`, specify the
        following request body fields:

        * `type` (must be `host`)
        * `key`
        * `deployment`
        * `region`

        To get details of an asset by `type` and `deployment`, specify the following request body fields:

        * `type` (must be `deployment`)
        * `deployment`

        To get details of an asset by `appliance_uuid` and `ip_address`, specify the following
        request body fields:

        * `appliance_uuid`
        * `ip_address`
        * `port` (optional, always provide if available)

        To get details of an asset by `type` and `uuid`, specify the following request body fields:

        * `type` (default: `any`)
        * `uuid`

        To get details of an asset by `deployment`, `ip address` and `network`, specify the following request body fields:

        * `deployment`
        * `ip_address`
        * `network`

        Note that when calling this endpoint with query options `deployment`, `network` and `ip_address` set, if a host is found,
        any subnet that the host isn't related to but it could be (the IP address matches the subnet mask) the additional unrelated
        subnet(s) will be returned under the `subnet` key in the response.

        Groups vulnerabilities for an account by exposure (by default), remediation, or vulnerable asset.
        In combination with filtering, it's easy to view vulnerabilities across your account in the manner
        most appropriate.

        *Note*: exposures uses a `threatiness` property which is an internal measurement used for
        relative comparison and is not considered useful to customers.

        Vulnerabilities can be filtered using the `filter` parameter in the query string. The `filter` param
        can be used multiple times. The [remediation filters](#section/Remediation-filters) documented above
        are allowed.

        Gets a list of remediation-items and an aggregation of filters associated with
        those remediation items. Filters similar to those in the Query Assets endpoint can be used with
        an item named `remediation-item`. The `filters` field in the output is the union of all `filters`
        fields in all the returned remediation items.

        Note that the returned `remediation-item` can also be filtered by various direct properties:

        * `audit_id`: If the `audit_ids` param is passed, return only `remediation-items` that match
          one of the given `audit_id`s.
        * `deployment_id`: If the `deployment_ids` param is passed, return only `remediation-items`
          that match one of the given `deployment_id`s.
        * `remediation_id`: If the `remediation_ids` param is passed, return only `remediation-items`
          that match one of the given `remediation_id`s.
        * `item_id`: If the `remediation_item_ids` param is passed, return only `remediation-items`
          that match one of the given `item_id`s.
        * `vulnerability_id`: If the `vulnerability_ids` param is passed, return only `remediation-items`
          that match one of the given `vulnerability_id`s.
        * The associated `remediation_item_id` is rendered on vinstances. Note: `details=true`
          is required to see vinstances on exposures.

        Render asset group topology data for the given account. The asset group can be defined by either a list of scopes
        that include/exclude assets, or a union or intersection of the set of assets in a list of existing nested groups.
        The response body shares the same format for both types of asset groups.

        In either case, a `return_asset_types` property can be provided that limits the previewed asset group results to the
        types in the list and all topological ancestor types of the listed types. Although the preview can be limited using
        the `return_asset_types` property, the actual asset group that is created using the other parameters will not have be
        limited to that list of types.

        Note that some assets in the `topology.data` object contain references to non-topologically related assets in the
        asset model that may be filtered on. For example, a `host` asset
        `814C2911-09BB-1005-9916-7831C1BAC182:host:/aws/us-east-1/host/web-1a-1` might contain an `image` property with
        an array of keys, like `/aws/us-east-1/image/ami-1`. These properties indicate that the assets can be filtered (via
        `include`/`exclude` in `scopes`), for example, placing the filter `host.image:/aws/us-east-1/image/ami-1` in the
        `include` of an asset-group scope would result in all hosts related to that image being included in the
        asset-group. These related assets are also included in the `topology.data` object, and can be found by constructing
        their data key, e.g., `814C2911-09BB-1005-9916-7831C1BAC182:image:/aws/us-east-1/image/ami-1`. Here are the
        non-topological filters by asset type:

        `dispose_remediations` disposes the vulnerability instances (`"vinstances"`) associated with a
        set of `remediations` or `vulnerabilities` (by ID). A set of `remediation-item`s is created, 1
        per deployment/remediation_id/vulnerability_id, with the state set to `"disposed"` and all
        vulnerability instances associated to that `"remediation_id"` or `"vulnerability_id"` on
        assets described by the given `"filters"` have their `"disposed"` property set to `true`.

        Note that, if the `"expires"` property is set on a `"disposed"` remediation-item, that item will
        be undisposed when the `"expires"` timestamp is in the past, and all associated vulnerability
        instances will have their `"disposed"` property set back to `false`.

        `conclude_remediations` concludes the vulnerability instances (`"vinstances"`) associated with a
        set of `remediations` or `vulnerabilities` (by ID). A set of `remediation-item`s is created, 1
        per deployment/remediation_id/vulnerability_id, with the state set to `"concluded"` and all
        vulnerability instances associated to that `"remediation_id"` or `"vulnerability_id"` on
        assets described by the given `"filters"` have their `"concluded"` property set to `true`.

        Note that once all associated vulnerabilities are resolved, `"concluded"` `remediation-item`s
        will be cleared from the system (resolved). Any matching vulnerability instance that is
        created or modified *after* the `"concluded"` `remediation-item`'s `modified_on` timestamp
        *will be* unconcluded (their `"concluded"` property will be set to `false`). If *all*
        existing vulnerability instances are newer than the `remediation-item`, then the
        `remediation-item` will be cleared (deleted).
