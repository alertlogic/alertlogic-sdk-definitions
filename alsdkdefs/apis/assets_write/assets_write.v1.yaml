    #### <a id="api-_-deprecated-asset-types"></a>Deprecated Asset Types

    The following types are deprecated but still supported; their preferred type names are mapped below:

    | Deprecated type name | Actual type name      |
    |----------------------|-----------------------|
    |`"environment"`       |`"deployment"`         |
    |`"location"`          |`"region"`             |
    |`"vnet"`              |`"vpc"`                |
    |`"vm"`                |`"host"`               |
    |`"vm-scale-set"`      |`"auto-scaling-group"` |

    Additionally, assets of type "tag" no longer need to be declared. Instead, "tag" assets are
    automatically derived from the presence of relationships to them declared on other assets.
    Only those "tag" relationships need to be declared.

    ### <a id="api-_-tag-rel-constraints"></a>Special Tag Relationship Constraints

    #### Tag names should be unique

    Because of the nature of tagging, assets may only be related to a single tag asset per unique
    `tag_name`. That is, a single asset **may not** be concurrently related to the tags `test: example1`
    and `test: example2`. Thus, when updating relationships (e.g., via operations like
    [declare_asset](#api-DeclareModify-DeclareAsset) or
    [declare_relationships](#api-DeclareModify-DeclareRelationships)), **only** the most recent
    relationship of type `tag` with a given `tag_name` will be retained.

    For technical context, asset tag names are derived from their asset key, which has the form:

    ```
    {ignored_prefix}/tag/key/{tag_name}/value/{tag_value}
    ```

    This means that, if an existing asset has a relationship to a tag like
    `/tag/key/test/value/example1` declared by **any** scope, and another client declares a relationship
    to `/tag/key/test/value/example2` in **any** scope, the relationship to
    `/tag/key/test/value/example1` will be superseded by the relationship to
    `/tag/key/test/value/example2`, and it will be deleted from the asset's `"relationships"` during
    the operation that declares the relationship to`/tag/key/test/value/example2`.

    Moreover, if a client declares relationships on a single asset to **multiple** tag assets with the
    same `tag_name`, the conflict will be resolved by retaining only the last instance in the
    `"relationships"` list, in addition to the removal of any previously existing relationships to tags
    with the same `tag_name`.

    #### Relationships must be declared on the tagged asset

    Tag assets should no longer be declared. To represent a tagged asset, declare a tag relationship on
    the tagged asset.

    For example, when representing a host asset with key `/aws/host1` and tagged with
    key `foo` and value `bar`, a relationship should be declared from the host asset `/aws/host1`
    to tag asset `/tag/key/foo/value/bar`.

    ### <a id="api-_-merge-properties"></a>Merging asset properties

    When declaring asset properties using operations like
    [declare_asset](#api-DeclareModify-DeclareAsset) or
    [declare_properties](#api-DeclareModify-DeclareProperties), the given properties are merged onto the
    existing asset using a complete replacement of each top-level property. For use cases where it is
    necessary to update a nested sub-property without eliminating its peer sub-properties, the client
    may pass a top-level path to the sub-property, with nested sub-properties separated by the period
    (`.`) character within the top-level property. Note that this behavior may also be used to declare
    new nested properties, avoiding the verbosity of expressing nested JSON.

    For example, given the existing asset:

    ```json
    {
      "scope_example_my-property" : {
        "sub-property-1": {
          "sub-sub-property-1": "update_me",
          "sub-sub-property-2": "do_not_delete"
        },
        "sub-property-2": "do_not_delete"
      }
    }
    ```

    If you wanted to update the property `"sub-sub-property-1"` above, without erasing
    `"sub-property-2"` or `"sub-sub-property-2"`, you could do so by updating the path
    `"my-property.sub-property-1.sub-sub-property-1"`; for example:

    ```json
    {
      "operation": "declare_properties",
      "scope": "example",
      "properties": {
        "my-property.sub-property-1.sub-sub-property-1": "updated"
      }
    }
    ```

    This would result in the asset's properties being merged accordingly, preserving
    the existing peer properties throughout the path:

    ```json
    {
      "scope_example_my-property" : {
        "sub-property-1": {
          "sub-sub-property-1": "updated",
          "sub-sub-property-2": "do_not_delete"
        },
        "sub-property-2": "do_not_delete"
      }
    }
    ```

    #### Merge properties restrictions

    Note that you cannot merge nested properties into assets with an existing parent property that is
    not an object. In the examples above, you cannot update the path 
    `"my-property.sub-property-2.sub-sub-property-2"` in the asset, because the parent path
    `"my-property.sub-property-2"` is a string, not an object. Requests to perform invalid merges like
    this will result in a `400 Bad Request` error.

      description: |-
        ## Declare Functions

        ### Create Network (operation:create_network)
        Declares (creates) a region and a network (an alias for VPC) with relationship to the region and
        with a claim key.

        ### Declare Applications (operation:declare_applications)
        
        `declare_applications` creates a set of assets of type `"application"` and adds relationships to the
        target asset, specified by the `type` and `key` parameters. If such asset doesn't exist, then
        declare_applications returns a HTTP 404 response. Declaring applications overwrites any existing
        applications of the same scope for that asset. declare_applications returns a HTTP 204 response
        upon success.

        ### Declare Environments (operation:declare_environment)
        Declares (creates) a deployment (née environment) in assets.
        
        The request must contain the environment's parameters in a JSON structure with the key items
        detailed below.

        ### Declare Vulnerabilities (operation:declare_vulnerabilities)
        Creates vulnerabilities and remediations and adds relationships to the asset
        which is vulnerable, specified by the `type` and `key` parameters. If such asset doesn't exist,
        then declare_vulnerabilities returns a HTTP 404 response. Declaring vulnerabilities overwrites
        any existing vulnerabilities of the same scope for that asset.

        ## Declare and Modify

        ### Accumulate Statistics (operation:accumulate)
        
        accumulates agents and appliances statistics. The accumulate operation may be called any number of
        times for the same asset. The updated asset will contain a statistics property with sub-properties
        for each accumulated statistic. This is intended to record collection statistics based on defined
        strategy by collection type on agent and appliance assets. Currently, only `hourly` strategy is
        supported. Hourly strategy records the last 24 calendar hours.
        
        Note that the response `last_hour` value is the previous hour, not the current hour value.
        `last_day` represents the sum of the all previous hours but the current hour.

        ### Declare Access Levels (operation:declare_access_levels)
        Declares access levels for the assets specified. If `asset`, `destination`, or
        any of `derives_from` assets don't exist, then declare_access_levels returns an `HTTP 404`
        response.

        ### Declare Asset (operation:declare_asset)
        
        `declare_asset` creates or [merges](#api-_-merge-properties) an asset and its relationships.
        declare_asset may be called any number of times for the same asset, with subsets of properties
        and relationships, and the assets service will merge the data. If a relationship is declared
        to an asset that doesn't exist, this asset will not be returned by assets_query until it is
        declared.

        ### Declare Properties (operation:declare_properties)
        
        declare_properties [merges properties](#api-_-merge-properties) with an existing asset. All fields
        are required, except `conditions` and `create`. This operation returns a HTTP/2 201 code on
        success.
        
        The following algorithm applies when calling `declare_properties`
        on a non-existent asset:
        
        - Apply the operation if the `create` property in the request body is `true`
        - Discard the operation if the `create` property in the request body is `false`
        - Apply the operation if there is no `create` property in the request body, but the `conditions` property is present
        - Discard the operation if both the `create` and `conditions` properties are not present in the request body
        
        The following algorithm applies when calling `declare_properties` on an existing asset:
        - Test conditions against the asset
          - If `conditions` is not present in the request body, or is present and the value is an empty list, apply the operation
          - if `conditions` is present and at least one condition is present
            - If all conditions are satisfied, apply the operation
            - If at least one condition is not satisfied, discard the operation and return a 304 status code
            - If, when applying the operation, a version mismatch is hit, retry the operation including the
              conditions evaluation and resulting behaviours
        
        There are two classes of conditions: *presence tests* and *comparisons*. All conditions require
        `property` field, which holds the name of the property being tested, and `type` field, which
        defines the test to be applied. Comparisons also must provide `value` field with value to compare
        existing data to.
        
        The following presence tests are defined:
        
        - `"if-defined"` - check whether existing asset has the property being tested
        - `"if-undefined"` - check whether existing asset doesn't have that property
        
        Following comparisons are defined:

        - `"if-equal"` - true if existing asset has the property being tested and its value is equal to
          the given one
        - `"if-not-equal"` - true if existing asset's value of the property being tested is not equal to
          the given one or existing asset has no such property
        - `"if-less"` - true if existing asset's value of the property being tested is less than the given
          one or existing asset has no such property
        - `"if-less-or-equal"` - true if existing asset's value of the property being tested is less than
          or equal to the given one or existing asset has no such property
        - `"if-greater"` - true if existing asset's value of the property being tested is greater than the
          given one or existing asset has no such property
        - `"if-greater-or-equal"` - true if existing asset's value of the property being tested is greater
          than or equal to the given one or existing asset has no such property

        ### Declare Relationships (operation:declare_relationships)
        
        `declare_relationships` creates or merges relationships for an existing asset. Calling
        `declare_relationships` on a non-existent asset will return a 404.

        ## Removals

        ### Remove Asset (operation:remove_asset)
        Deletes an existing asset and its relationships.

        ### Remove Assets (operation:remote_assets)
        Deletes multiple existing assets and their relationships.

        ### Remove Properties (operation:remove_properties)
        Completely removes the given properties (or nested properties) from the given asset.

        ### Remove Relationships (operation:remove_relationships)
        Deletes specific relationships for an existing asset.
